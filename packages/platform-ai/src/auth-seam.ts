/**
 * Handshake-time session authentication seam (L2 §Mechanism Variant 3).
 *
 * The Platform AI Worker mounts a same-origin WS route (`claw.amio.fans/ai-ws/*`)
 * so the auth-session cookie rides along on the upgrade request. Before the
 * upgrade is accepted, the Worker must validate that cookie and resolve a
 * `userId`; an invalid/absent session is rejected at the handshake (401, no
 * upgrade).
 *
 * This module is the seam for that check, kept pure and dependency-light so it
 * is unit-testable without a live KV / network:
 *
 *  - `SessionReader` is the one-method contract: cookie header in, resolved
 *    identity out (or `null` when there is no valid session).
 *  - `createDevAuthBypassReader` is the dev-only stub: when `DEV_AUTH_BYPASS`
 *    is on it returns a fixed development identity for demo / local runs,
 *    standing in for the real `AUTH` KV lookup.
 *  - `createKvSessionReader` is the real reader: it reads `session:<id>` from
 *    the bound `AUTH` KV and resolves the identity. The cookie name and the
 *    `session:<id>` key + value schema are auth-session's real contract
 *    (`shared/auth-types.ts` `SESSION_COOKIE_NAME`,
 *    `packages/api/src/auth/{kv-keys,session}.ts`); this reader consumes a
 *    minimal structural view of that real record and never writes.
 *  - `resolveSessionReader` is the compile/run-time gate that picks the dev
 *    stub vs. the real reader from env, so the prod path never carries the stub.
 *
 * The mounting contract ("validate at handshake, reject if invalid, bind
 * userId") is fixed regardless of which reader is active.
